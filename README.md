# Movie-Correlations
A quick little movie industry correlation project done in Python! The Jupyter notebook is included in this repository above. 

I also visualized some of this data in Tableau and had some fun making it at least a little movie themed, please check it out [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/megan.schlebecker/viz/MovieIndustry_16735452707840/Dashboard1). 

Thanks!
